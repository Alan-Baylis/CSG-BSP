# CSG-BSP
The goal of this project is to have an implementation of Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) operations for various platforms and rendering engines. CSG is a modeling technique that allows for the use of boolean and set operations on geometric solids in order to create new solids. The CSG operations in this library are implemented using BSP trees, which allow for the straight-forward sub-division and categorization of the polygons that make up a 3D geometric sold.
 
Currently functionality is only implemented in C# for the Unity 3D game engine, but I plan to implement the library in C++ for general OpenGL usage, as well as a specialized version for the Unreal engine.
